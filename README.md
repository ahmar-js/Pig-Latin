# Pig-Latin
A program that lets the user enter some English text, then converts the text to Pig-Latin. To review, Pig-Latin takes the first letter of a word, puts it at the end, and appends “ay”. The only exception is if the first letter is a vowel, in which case we keep it as it is and append “hay” to the end. For example: “hello” -> “ellohay”, and “image” -> “imagehay”
